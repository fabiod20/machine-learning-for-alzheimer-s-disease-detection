# machine-learning-for-alzheimer-s-disease-detection
This repository contains the solution proposed for the first Mini-Contest of the **Data Mining** course of *University of Naples Federico II*.

The contest aims at exploiting Machine Learning for Alzheimer's disease detection. The task is to determine whether a patient has or not the disease, by means of a machine learning model trained on some medical high-level information.

The solution shown in the Notebook is made up of two main stages:
- **Preprocessing**: data cleaning and dealing with missing values.
- **Modeling**: several models have been compared for our purpose, such as *decision tree*, *k-nearest neighbour*, *logistic regression* and *multi layer perceptron*, but the best one turned out to be *support vector machine*.
